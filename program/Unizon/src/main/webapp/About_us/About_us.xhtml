					<h2 align="center">What is the Unison?</h2>
					<p style="margin-top:6pt;margin-bottom:12pt">
					The Unison was found in 2013 by the students of Information Technology Faculty of the University of Debrecen
					The main reason why this webshop exists is that students can buy easier.  In the first year, we thought 
					about students who move in boarding school and do not know the city. They do not know where they can get 
					the things they need. After the successful beginning, we want to make better and easier other people's 
					life. By today we are one of the determinant webshop in Hungary. It can purchase among more than 5000 
					products and it's number is increasing. This shop won a fourth place in the competition of County's shop 
					in 2015.</p>

					<h2 align="center">What kind of product we offer?</h2>
					<p style="margin-top:6pt;margin-bottom:12pt">
					We do not only offer goods for sales, which help students in learning, for example books, e-books, laptop, 
					tablet. We put up for sale things that help students to relax. But other people like have a rest, so our 
					buyer's number augments. In our webshop available some other things like dress and accessories too. Our 
					offer is growing with more and more information technology's product.

					<h2 align="center">Plans for future.</h2>
					<p style="margin-top:6pt;margin-bottom:12pt">
					Due to the successful start, we have more and more opportunities to develop and supporters that support us 
					to the further growth. Our company's seat is transferred from the IT Faculty to the Main Building of 
					University. In the Future we want to serve other purchaser. Primary target is the foreign students. We 
					want to that our webshop can be available in hungarian. We plan to separate from the network of University 
					and we want to establish own servers.
